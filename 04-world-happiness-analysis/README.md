## 📘 Project Overview

This project analyzes the **World Happiness Report dataset** using SQL.
The dataset includes multiple factors that influence a country’s overall happiness score such as GDP, social support, corruption perception, freedom, generosity, and healthy life expectancy.

The goal of this project is to use SQL to explore global patterns, rank countries, compare regions, and uncover insights about well-being across the world.
